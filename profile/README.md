# Baztille

**Baztille is an open civic-tech platform designed to enable citizen-initiated decision-making that is transparent, auditable, and accessible.**

Unlike most civic participation tools, Baztille is built around a **bottom-up model**:
ideas, subjects, proposals, arguments and votes originate **from citizens themselves** — not from elected representatives, institutions, or platform operators.

The project focuses on providing a trustworthy technical foundation for local and collective democratic processes, with a strong emphasis on openness and verifiability.

## 🧭 Project philosophy

Baztille follows two core principles:

> **Democratic legitimacy comes from citizens.**  
> **Any system that counts votes must be open to scrutiny.**

This means that:
- all political content (ideas, subjects, propositions, arguments) is **initiated by citizens**
- the platform does **not** impose agendas, topics or outcomes
- the **backend** is released under a strong copyleft license (AGPL)
- the **clients** are separated and more permissively licensed
- transparency is treated as a technical requirement, not a promise

## 🧩 Other repositories

This organization also contains:
- forks of third-party libraries
- experimental or supporting components
- technical adaptations required by the project

These repositories exist for engineering reasons and are **not entry points** to the Baztille platform.
