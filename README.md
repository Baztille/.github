### 🔐 Backend (core democratic logic)

## 🧭 Project philosophy

Baztille follows a simple principle:

> **Any system that counts votes must be open to scrutiny.**

This is why:
- the **backend** is released under a strong copyleft license (AGPL)
- the **clients** are separated and more permissively licensed
- transparency is treated as a technical requirement, not a promise

## 🧩 Other repositories

This organization also contains:
- forks of third-party libraries
- experimental or supporting components
- technical adaptations required by the project

These repositories exist for engineering reasons and are **not entry points** to the Baztille platform.
